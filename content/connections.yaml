# Chapter ↔ Paper Connections
#
# This file tracks relationships between chapters and paper explanations.
# It enables bidirectional navigation and helps readers discover related content.
#
# Relationship types:
#   - foundational: The paper is central to the chapter's content
#   - extends: The paper builds on chapter concepts
#   - applies: The paper applies techniques from the chapter
#   - related: Tangential connection worth noting
#   - critiques: The paper challenges ideas from the chapter
