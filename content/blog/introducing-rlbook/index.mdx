I am excited to announce [rlbook.ai](https://rlbook.ai)—a platform that aspires to be the most comprehensive resource for learning reinforcement learning (RL), from beginner to advanced levels. Much of the content will be AI-generated, then reviewed by myself (and hopefully others) and improved over time.

Beyond being an online resource for RL, this platform is an experiment in how AI can be used to create educational content. That's what I want to explore in this post.

## The Painful Process of Creating Educational Content Manually

I've spent a significant chunk of my life teaching, though it's not my main profession. I gave volunteer and paid tutoring as an undergrad, served as a teaching assistant during my PhD, then worked as adjunct faculty for years. Later, I became an author and wrote [*Mastering Reinforcement Learning with Python*](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Reinforcement-Learning-Python-next-generation/dp/1838644148). I also created an RL course for an online platform. Throughout all this experience, I was told I was a decent educator—my book has some nice reviews on Amazon, for example.

Looking back, though, all those efforts were incredibly time-consuming. At times, I very much regretted taking on those responsibilities. For example, I was significantly delayed on my book timelines. Writing a chapter took weeks, and I was never satisfied with the outcome. The process looked like this:

1. **Research**: I gathered all the relevant resources and papers and read them.
2. **Design**: I planned the flow of the chapter and the case study.
3. **Writing**: This was painful, especially as a non-native English speaker. I struggled to find the best ways to express concepts in written form.
4. **Diagrams**: Creating visuals was time-consuming, and the results rarely met my expectations.
5. **Code**: In theory, the RL case studies were great for conveying ideas. In practice, getting them to work properly—let alone being great examples—took many iterations.

In short, I saw myself as someone who could envision good design for my content but struggled to turn that vision into reality. Too much time went into low-level tasks like fixing a diagram's style or crafting a working code example.

As with many other things, I think AI has fundamentally changed this. Many of those pain points are now gone.

rlbook.ai is an attempt to reimagine technical education in this new era.

## Creating Educational Content in the Era of AI

To be clear, I think the ultimate state for AI-based education is a personalized AI assistant that knows you so well it tailors every topic to your exact preferences. Until then, I believe AI will help educators with low-level tasks while educators serve as curriculum designers and content supervisors. A couple of recent experiences helped me realize what this interim state of AI-assisted education might look like.

In 2025, I worked on a project to create educational content for my local community—teaching our culture to our youth in the U.S. We spent weeks contemplating the right format and tried to create content accordingly. While our results were okay, we got significantly better results when we fed our insights to Claude and had the entire curriculum generated by it. All we had to do was iterate by updating our prompts. This was a wake-up call for me.

Around the same time, a major publisher reached out about a book project related to RL. Although I'm always excited about such opportunities, some things didn't make sense. A technical book isn't about generating novel ideas—it's about conveying existing knowledge effectively. And books have major drawbacks due to their static nature:

- **Books require a cutoff, but learning never stops.** You can always think of better ways to explain something. But book writing forces you to freeze and move on—you can't iterate for long. Once published, you're locked in until the next edition.
- **The feedback cycle is slow.** If someone makes a great suggestion about a chapter, you have to wait years to incorporate it.
- **Books aren't the best medium for animations**, which can greatly improve the effectiveness of content.
- **In a field like AI, things evolve fast** and your content gets outdated quickly.

That's why I believe the right format is a live web platform where content gets updated frequently with community input, with the help of AI.

## The Vision for rlbook.ai

My dream content for this platform would combine:

- The exceptional animated presentation style of [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)
- The interactive presentation of technical concepts as in [Distill.pub](https://distill.pub/)
- The availability of hands-on material as in [D2L.ai](https://d2l.ai/)

To this end, here's the flywheel I aim to establish:

1. **Prompts as first-class citizens**: Content will be primarily controlled and generated via AI prompts, which are versioned in the [repository](https://github.com/ebilgin/rlbook) and evolve over time with feedback.

2. **AI-generated initial content**: The initial content on a topic will be generated via prompts that follow the platform's broader standards. These standards are imposed by platform-level and chapter-level prompts, which evolve over time. These guardrail prompts are the platform's advantage over someone generating content from scratch on their own. That said, there's a non-zero chance that AI slop leaks through—that's why content at this level is marked "AI Generated" to let readers know.

3. **Editor review**: Once AI-generated content is reviewed by editors, most AI slop should be gone. The content should then be trustworthy and consistent with the rest of the platform.

4. **Community feedback**: From the moment content is published, it's open for feedback via [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) comments and [Discord](https://discord.gg/mJ7n3zNf7r) discussions. This is the main input I'm hoping to collect to collectively improve the content.

5. **Verified state**: Once community feedback is incorporated and coding examples are verified to work, the content reaches a mature, verified state.

This is the high-level idea. There's a lot to figure out along the way.

## Conclusion

rlbook.ai is an experiment in AI-first educational content generation. Exactly how this will work, we'll see.
