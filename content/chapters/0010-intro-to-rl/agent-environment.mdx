## The Components of RL

Let's define our terms more precisely.

<Intuition>

**Agent**: The learner and decision-maker. This is what we're building.

**Environment**: Everything outside the agent. The world it interacts with.

**State** ($s$): A description of the current situation. In a chess game, the positions of all pieces. In driving, your location, speed, and surroundings.

**Action** ($a$): A choice the agent can make. Move a chess piece, press the accelerator, turn left.

**Reward** ($r$): A number indicating how good the outcome was. Win the game: +1. Lose: -1. Each step in a maze: -0.01 (encouraging speed).

**Policy** ($\pi$): The agent's strategy—a mapping from states to actions. "In this state, do that."

**Value**: How good a state (or action) is in the long run. High value means lots of future reward expected.

## A Simple Example: GridWorld

Throughout this book, we'll use **GridWorld** as our primary example environment. It's simple enough to understand completely, yet rich enough to illustrate key concepts.

<Intuition>

Imagine a 4×4 grid. Your agent starts in one corner. The goal is in the opposite corner. Each step, the agent can move up, down, left, or right (if not blocked by a wall).

```
┌───┬───┬───┬───┐
│ A │   │   │   │
├───┼───┼───┼───┤
│   │   │   │   │
├───┼───┼───┼───┤
│   │   │   │   │
├───┼───┼───┼───┤
│   │   │   │ G │
└───┴───┴───┴───┘
```

- **State**: The agent's position (row, column)
- **Actions**: Up, Down, Left, Right
- **Reward**: -1 for each step (encourages finding the shortest path), +10 for reaching the goal
- **Episode**: Ends when the agent reaches the goal

This simple setup illustrates the core RL loop: observe position, choose direction, receive reward, repeat.
