# What is Reinforcement Learning?

<ChapterObjectives>
- Define reinforcement learning and distinguish it from supervised and unsupervised learning
- Understand the core idea: learning from interaction and consequences
- See real-world examples of RL in action, from games to LLMs
- Know the key milestones in RL's history
</ChapterObjectives>

## Chapter Overview

Every time you teach a dog a trick, you're doing reinforcement learning. Every time you learn which route to work avoids traffic, you're doing reinforcement learning. It's perhaps the most natural form of learning—and also one of the most powerful approaches in artificial intelligence.

In this chapter, we'll explore what makes RL unique, see it in action across many domains, and trace its journey from theoretical foundations to powering today's most impressive AI systems.
